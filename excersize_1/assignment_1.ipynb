    "\n",
    "Formulate a schedule that __minimizes the total under-allocation of each department to operating rooms.__ For  example, General Surgery currently  receives 48.4% of the total operating room time, and should therefore receive 48.4% of the total operating room time in the new schedule as well. In particular, the CEO has specified that under-allocation is to be avoided, meaning a penalty should be incurred if a department is allocated __less__ than its target %, but there should be no penalty if a department is allocated __more__ than its target % of operating room time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Your model should produce a new schedule that minimizes the total under-allocation (on  apercentage basis). The reason for representing allocation on a percentage basis is that usingunits of time is not equitable: For example, a loss of 1 hour per week is much more disruptiveto Oral Surgery (currently 10 hrs/week) than it is for General Surgery (92 hrs/week)."
